# Product Context – Why this project exists

Snowflake access management often requires engineers to use the Snowflake UI or craft SQL statements manually. This is time-consuming, error-prone, and forces exposure of private keys on local machines. Additionally, monitoring and debugging production issues requires access to multiple tools and interfaces, creating operational complexity.

Our app eliminates that friction by:
1. Abstracting complex SQL into one-click UI workflows (stored procedure calls under the hood).
2. Handling secure key-pair generation in-browser, never uploading private keys.
3. Offering OAuth-based authentication that aligns with enterprise SSO, avoiding password storage.
4. Providing visibility into existing databases/schemas/roles for faster role assignment.
5. Delivering real-time system monitoring with professional log viewing and debugging capabilities.
6. Consolidating all Snowflake administration tasks into a unified, professional interface.

Target users: DevOps and Data Engineers who maintain multiple Snowflake environments and need comprehensive administrative and monitoring capabilities.
