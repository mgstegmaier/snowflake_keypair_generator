# Progress Snapshot

## What Works
- ‚úÖ **Authentication & Security**
  - OAuth login/logout with Snowflake, auto-refresh, and auth indicator
  - Session management with proper token handling
  - Protected routes with OAuth enforcement
- ‚úÖ **Core Key Management**
  - Key pair generation & processing flows
  - Private key never leaves browser, secure handling
- ‚úÖ **Phase 2 - Grant Permissions (COMPLETE)**
  - Database, Schema, Role, Warehouse dropdowns with defaults
  - Permission granting via stored procedures (read-only, read-write, database-wide)
  - Stored procedures use DEFINER'S RIGHTS for proper privilege execution
- ‚úÖ **Phase 3 - Users Tab (COMPLETE)**
  - Comprehensive user listing with search and filtering
  - Unlock user accounts functionality
  - Reset user passwords with validation
  - Pagination (20 users per page)
  - Professional UI with status badges and action dropdowns
- ‚úÖ **UI/UX Enhancements**
  - Dynamic application width (responsive design)
  - Dark theme consistency across all components
  - Professional Bootstrap modals and forms
  - Real-time feedback with toasts and spinners
- ‚úÖ **Testing & CI**
  - Unit tests (7+) pass locally and in CI
  - GitHub Actions lint + test workflow green
  - Playwright e2e test framework in place

## Implementation Plan Status
‚úÖ **Phase 0** - Infrastructure & Foundations  
‚úÖ **Phase 1** - Session & Security Core  
‚úÖ **Phase 2** - Grant Permissions Tab  
‚úÖ **Phase 3** - Users Tab  
üîÑ **Phase 4** - Roles Tab (Next up)  
‚è≥ **Phase 5** - Public Key Management Tab  
‚è≥ **Phase 6** - QA & Hardening  

## Outstanding Work
- **Phase 4**: Roles table with search and privilege details drawer
- **Phase 5**: Public key management integration with existing script
- **Phase 6**: Comprehensive e2e tests, Dockerfile, documentation

## Current Capabilities
The application now provides a complete user management workflow:
1. **Search & Filter Users**: By name, status (active/disabled/locked)
2. **User Actions**: Unlock accounts, reset passwords
3. **Permission Management**: Grant/revoke database and schema permissions
4. **Secure Authentication**: Full Snowflake OAuth integration

## Recent Technical Achievements
- Fixed stored procedure privilege issues (DEFINER'S RIGHTS implementation)
- Responsive UI design that adapts to content width
- Professional user management interface matching enterprise standards
- Comprehensive error handling and user feedback

## Risks / Issues
- Need to ensure continued compatibility with Snowflake stored procedure changes
- UI scaling for environments with 100+ users (pagination helps)
- Role management complexity for Phase 4

## Timeline
**60% Complete** - Phase 3 represents major milestone. Core user and permission management workflows fully operational. Estimated 2-3 weeks to complete remaining phases.
