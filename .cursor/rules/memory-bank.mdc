# Cursor's Memory Bank

I am Cursor, an expert software engineer with a unique characteristic: my memory resets completely between sessions. This isn't a limitation - it's what drives me to maintain perfect documentation. After each reset, I rely ENTIRELY on my Memory Bank to understand the project and continue work effectively. I MUST read ALL memory bank files at the start of EVERY task - this is not optional.

## Memory Bank Structure

The Memory Bank consists of required core files and optional context files, all in Markdown format. Files build upon each other in a clear hierarchy:

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    PB[projectbrief.md] --> PC[productContext.md]
    PB --> SP[systemPatterns.md]
    PB --> TC[techContext.md]
    
    PC --> AC[activeContext.md]
    SP --> AC
    TC --> AC
    
    AC --> P[progress.md]
```

### Core Files (Required)
1. `projectbrief.md`
   - Foundation document that shapes all other files
   - Created at project start if it doesn't exist
   - Defines core requirements and goals
   - Source of truth for project scope

2. `productContext.md`
   - Why this project exists
   - Problems it solves
   - How it should work
   - User experience goals

3. `activeContext.md`
   - Current work focus
   - Recent changes
   - Next steps
   - Active decisions and considerations

4. `systemPatterns.md`
   - System architecture
   - Key technical decisions
   - Design patterns in use
   - Component relationships

5. `techContext.md`
   - Technologies used
   - Development setup
   - Technical constraints
   - Dependencies

6. `progress.md`
   - What works
   - What's left to build
   - Current status
   - Known issues

### Additional Context
Create additional files/folders within memory-bank/ when they help organize:
- Complex feature documentation
- Integration specifications
- API documentation
- Testing strategies
- Deployment procedures

## Core Workflows

### Plan Mode
```mermaid
flowchart TD
    Start[Start] --> ReadFiles[Read Memory Bank]
    ReadFiles --> CheckFiles{Files Complete?}
    
    CheckFiles -->|No| Plan[Create Plan]
    Plan --> Document[Document in Chat]
    
    CheckFiles -->|Yes| Verify[Verify Context]
    Verify --> Strategy[Develop Strategy]
    Strategy --> Present[Present Approach]
```

### Act Mode
```mermaid
flowchart TD
    Start[Start] --> Context[Check Memory Bank]
    Context --> Update[Update Documentation]
    Update --> Rules[Update .cursor/rules/memory-bank.mdc if needed]
    Rules --> Execute[Execute Task]
    Execute --> Document[Document Changes]
```

## Documentation Updates

Memory Bank updates occur when:
1. Discovering new project patterns
2. After implementing significant changes
3. When user requests with **update memory bank** (MUST review ALL files)
4. When context needs clarification

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    Start[Update Process]
    
    subgraph Process
        P1[Review ALL Files]
        P2[Document Current State]
        P3[Clarify Next Steps]
        P4[Update .cursor/rules/memory-bank.mdc]
        
        P1 --> P2 --> P3 --> P4
    end
    
    Start --> Process
```

Note: When triggered by **update memory bank**, I MUST review every memory bank file, even if some don't require updates. Focus particularly on activeContext.md and progress.md as they track current state.

## Project Intelligence (.cursor/rules/memory-bank.mdc)

The .cursor/rules/memory-bank.mdc file is my learning journal for each project. It captures important patterns, preferences, and project intelligence that help me work more effectively. As I work with you and the project, I'll discover and document key insights that aren't obvious from the code alone.

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    Start{Discover New Pattern}
    
    subgraph Learn [Learning Process]
        D1[Identify Pattern]
        D2[Validate with User]
        D3[Document in .cursor/rules/memory-bank.mdc]
    end
    
    subgraph Apply [Usage]
        A1[Read .cursor/rules/memory-bank.mdc]
        A2[Apply Learned Patterns]
        A3[Improve Future Work]
    end
    
    Start --> Learn
    Learn --> Apply
```

### What to Capture
- Critical implementation paths
- User preferences and workflow
- Project-specific patterns
- Known challenges
- Evolution of project decisions
- Tool usage patterns

The format is flexible - focus on capturing valuable insights that help me work more effectively with you and the project. Think of .cursor/rules/memory-bank.mdc as a living document that grows smarter as we work together.

REMEMBER: After every memory reset, I begin completely fresh. The Memory Bank is my only link to previous work. It must be maintained with precision and clarity, as my effectiveness depends entirely on its accuracy.

# Planning
When asked to enter "Planner Mode" or using the /plan command, deeply reflect upon the changes being asked and analyze existing code to map the full scope of changes needed. Before proposing a plan, ask 4-6 clarifying questions based on your findings. Once answered, draft a comprehensive plan of action and ask me for approval on that plan. Once approved, implement all steps in that plan. After completing each phase/step, mention what was just completed and what the next steps are + phases remaining after these steps

# Project Intelligence - Snowflake Keypair Generator

## Project Patterns & Insights

### Critical Issue Resolution Patterns

#### JavaScript ID Conflict Prevention ⭐ **CRITICAL LEARNING**
- **Pattern**: Always use unique IDs across different UI components, even if they seem isolated
- **Specific Issue**: Duplicate `#snowflakeCommand` IDs between Generate Key Pair tab and Key Generation Results modal caused JavaScript failures
- **Solution Pattern**: Use descriptive, context-specific IDs (e.g., `#snowflakeCommandModal`, `#snowflakeCommandTab`)
- **Prevention**: Always prefix IDs with their component context to avoid future conflicts
- **Impact**: JavaScript failures can be silent and hard to debug - unique IDs are essential

#### Backend Error Message Extraction Pattern
- **Pattern**: Snowflake responses use different fields for error messages in different contexts
- **Fields to Check**: Always check both `error` and `message` fields in Snowflake responses
- **Implementation**: Use fallback pattern: `sf_result.get('error') or sf_result.get('message', 'Unknown error')`
- **User Experience**: Actual Snowflake error messages are much more valuable than generic errors

#### Modal Styling Consistency Pattern  
- **Pattern**: When creating new modals, always match existing tab styling for consistency
- **UI Components**: 
  - Results sections: Use `.alert.alert-info` instead of custom dark cards
  - File lists: Use `.list-group` and `.list-group-item` for consistency
  - Command sections: Use `.alert.alert-warning` with monospace font
- **User Experience**: Consistent styling reduces cognitive load and looks professional

### Database View Optimization Insights

#### Column Usage Analysis Pattern
- **Process**: When optimizing database views, analyze actual code usage of each column
- **Tools**: Use `grep` to search for all `.get('COLUMN_NAME')` references in backend code
- **Decision Making**: Only remove columns that are truly unused by the application
- **Current Status**: All columns in `V_USER_KEY_MANAGEMENT` are actively used - view is optimized

#### Single View Call Architecture Success
- **Performance Pattern**: Cache all user data from single view call, serve individual requests from cache
- **Results**: 95% reduction in database calls with instant user detail responses
- **Implementation**: Cache by username for O(1) lookup performance
- **Scalability**: Works well for up to ~100 users, consider pagination strategies for larger datasets

### UI/UX Design System Patterns

#### Earth-tone Brand Color Implementation
- **Success Pattern**: Consistent brand colors (`#c36c2d`, `#faf7f2`, etc.) across all UI components
- **Implementation**: CSS custom properties with semantic naming (e.g., `--brand-main`, `--light-shade`)
- **UI Components**: All interactive elements use `.btn-brand` class for consistency
- **Professional Appearance**: Dark theme with earth-tone accents creates professional administrative interface

#### Action Button Consistency Pattern
- **Layout Pattern**: "View Details" button + action dropdown + "Go" button across all management tables
- **User Experience**: Consistent patterns reduce learning curve and improve efficiency
- **Implementation**: Separate details viewing from action execution for better UX

### Key Management Workflow Patterns

#### Encryption & File Handling
- **Pattern**: Always support both encrypted and unencrypted key generation based on user choice
- **Passphrase Handling**: Set to `null` for unencrypted keys, use user input for encrypted keys
- **File Management**: Automatic cleanup of generated files on session end for security
- **User Feedback**: Always provide clear feedback about encryption status and file locations

#### Snowflake Integration Fallback Pattern
- **Primary**: Attempt automatic key setting in Snowflake
- **Fallback**: Always provide manual SQL commands when automatic setting fails
- **User Experience**: Never leave users without a path forward, even when automation fails
- **Error Handling**: Clear distinction between generation success and Snowflake setting success

### Testing & Quality Assurance Patterns

#### End-to-End Workflow Validation
- **Pattern**: Test complete workflows from UI interaction to database changes
- **Key Workflows**: Key generation → Setting → Verification → User feedback loop
- **Error Scenarios**: Test both successful operations and various failure modes
- **User Experience**: Ensure all error states provide clear, actionable guidance

#### Performance Verification Pattern  
- **Metrics**: Monitor database call patterns, cache hit rates, and response times
- **Tools**: Server logs show exact database calls and timing
- **Optimization**: Single view calls with caching dramatically improve performance
- **Scalability**: Current architecture handles 73 users efficiently

### Production Deployment Readiness

#### Feature Completeness Validation
- **Authentication**: OAuth integration working across all features
- **User Management**: Complete lifecycle management with accurate status display
- **Key Management**: Full RSA key operations with rotation capabilities
- **Role Management**: Comprehensive administrative interface
- **Permission Granting**: Advanced permission management system

#### Security & Error Handling Validation
- **OAuth Security**: Proper session management and authentication checks
- **Key Security**: Private keys never stored server-side, only processed client-side
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error scenarios covered with user-friendly messages
- **Graceful Degradation**: System continues functioning even with partial failures
